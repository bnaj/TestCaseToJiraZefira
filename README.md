# TestCaseToJiraZefira



Hello I&#39;m automate tester and this project become to life because i neead some tool to export test scenario from docx files to Zephira. I&#39;m not a programmer and... I do not assume any liability for the operation of this program :) (Don&#39;t worry work fine for me :D)

How do you can see, my skills in English are on the same level. But i do what i can to show you how it work.



Intel i9-7900X or equivalent

1. GTX Titan Z
2. 16Giga of ram
3. Vr helm (no matter what manufacturer) you need is to read cmd logs......

I joked, you need:

1. java
2. If you read this i suppose you have account on Jira.
3. Your must have checked options in jira configuration which Enabling the Remote API.
4. Link how do this: [https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/enabling-the-remote-api-150460.html](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/enabling-the-remote-api-150460.html)
5. You must have active Zephyr and Zapi. (You can bought it on jira market). If you pay for Zephyr you must pay also for Zapi!!! its terrible.

Application should work on Linux and Windows (using Linux is better;)).

In this card i tell you how start this program.

1. You can download repo and start this in some ide.
2. You can download jar and open it in cmd or Linux terminal.

For Windows users go to start enter cmd, hit comandline. Go to folder where you download TestCaseToJiraZefira.jar. In comand line enter java -jar TestCaseToJiraZefira.jar.

Ok here we have simple test scenarioâ€¦

How you can see **summary** is in first row then you enter 1 in **first field** but text what we need is in the second cell, in the **second field** you enter 2.

Simple.

Description, row of **description** is second then we enter 2 in **third field** text is in second cell then we enter 2 int **fourth field .**

In this configuration when program starts take summary and descripton and start load steps.

| Summary: | Firs TS |
| --- | --- |
| Description: | Description to first TS |
| Step 1 | This is  step 1 s1 | This is resoult of  1 s1 |

Ok what with **field number 5**?

Ok in this case we have one more row after steps.

Now its time to enter row when test steps start. In this case it be 4. Enter 4 to **5 field**.

When program starts load summary and description leave my company id and start load test steps.

| Summary: | Firs TS |
| --- | --- |
| Description: | Description to first TS |
| My company id | Namme of company |
| Step 1 | This is  step 1 s1 | This is resoult of  1 s1 |

**Number, 6 Checkbox** if your test scenario loks like:

| Summary: | Firs TS |

| Step 2 | This is  step 2 s1 | This data of  2 s1 | This is resoult of  2 s1 |
